> Nintendo Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL and Tableau

# Hello Everyone!
In this project I'll be using SQL to find important data questions that I have come up with to explore more about the correlation to critic and user reviews and the effects it has on total amount of sales. Following that, I'll gather the results of my findings and will create a dashboard via Tableau to highlight my findings. 
- You can find my Tableau dashboard here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/minh.doan1078/viz/NintendoProject_16454231265120/Dashboard1 



## Some information I am looking to get from the data ## 
1.	Top 10 most popular games based on critic score and user score.
2.	ESRB rating distribution of all video games.
3.	Top 10 most popular games based off sales.
4.	Highest rated video games from each generation (Top 3)
      - Nintendo 64, GameBoy, GameCube, Wii, DS, WiiU, 3DS, Switch
6.	Total sales per Nintendo console (This will be taken from google not from data)


## Hypothesis and Questions ##

1.	Are sales dictated around metascore?
2.	Do games have an effect on sales of total platforms sold?
3.	Does IP matter when it comes to the sale of video games?

## Are sales dictated around metascore? ##

According to the best selling Nintendo games and best video games based on metascore (critic and user), it appears that is has no coorelation with one another. None 
of the games on the best reviewed games are within reach of the best selling games by Nintendo. This can confirm my hypothesis that metascore does not take into account 
of the total sales and its success. Although, there is a caveat where some of the highest rated games belong to a specific IP (Mario) which we will go over later.

## Do games have an effect on sales of total platforms sold? ##

The Nintendo 64 and GameCube both had 4 games that were highly rated among critics and users alike. The Nintendo 64 and GameCube both had 4 games rated the highest with 4 video 
games each accord to critic score and user score. While the Gamecube had 3 of the best games according to user score. Although the Nintendo 64 and GameCube had some of the best 
games ever produced, they sat among the lowest selling consoles only ahead of the WiiU. Once again, the highest quality of games dictated by reviews do not increase the sales 
of that particular console.

## Does Intellectual Property matter when it comes to the sale of video Games? ##

Based off of this chart, we can see that the best selling game of all time is Wii Sports. Following that we have 4 Mario Games, 3 Pokemon games, another Wii game, and finally
Animal Crossing. We can quickly see that Mario is one of Nintendo's best rated video games due to the amount of games that has been sold at high volumes. We can conclude
from a brief look of this data that intellectual property plays a large role of sales. This would primary include Mario, Pokemon and Wii games with an outlier being Animal Crossing. 

## Nintendo's Approach to Business ##

After looking at all the data presented to us, we can see that Nintendo is known for having some of the best rated intellectual properties of all time including Mario, The 
Legend of Zelda, Pokemon and many others that were not included. However, we can see that Nintendo's strength relies heavily on evolving and innovation of their beloved 
franchises. With the failure of WiiU sales, the Nintendo Switch has become a household sensation as a hybrid console. It is clear to me that Nintendo has a different
approach to video games than their other competitors. Following up with their business strategy, their forward approach should be to focus on creating games for all all gamers
and non-traditional games while innovating their future consoles such as the Nintendo Switch and Wii. Another aspect of their business should be to continuing to produce 
video games from their best and highly rated franchises as people seem to love them (including me).
