> Nintendo Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL and Tableau

# Hello Everyone!
In this project I'll be using SQL to find important data questions that I have come up with to explore more about the correlation to critic and user reviews and the effects it has on total amount of sales. Following that, I'll gather the results of my findings and will create a dashboard via Tableau to highlight my findings. The data I used on this project was from kaggle ([nintendovideogames.csv](https://github.com/mnhdn07/Nintendo-Data-Project/files/8102902/nintendovideogames.csv))



## Some information I am looking to get from the data ## 
1.	Top 10 most popular games based on critic score and user score.
2.	ESRB rating distribution of all video games.
3.	Top 10 most popular games based off sales.
4.	Highest rated video games from each generation (Top 3)
      - Nintendo 64, GameBoy, GameCube, Wii, DS, WiiU, 3DS, Switch
6.	Total sales per Nintendo console (This will be taken from google not from data)


## Hypothesis and Questions ##

1.	Are sales dictated around metascore?
2.	Do games have an effect on sales of total platforms sold?
3.	Does IP matter when it comes to the sale of video games?
